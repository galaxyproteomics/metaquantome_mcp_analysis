# metaquantome_mcp_analysis
Analysis scripts for the metaQuantome MCP paper

All of the scripts were run with metaQuantome 0.99.3, which was obtained through Bioconda.

To reproduce the analyses, you can install metaQuantome into a conda environment (called `mqome` in this repository) with the following command.

```
conda create -n mqome metaquantome
```

Then each of the analysis scripts can be run.
