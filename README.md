# metaquantome_mcp_analysis
Analysis scripts for the metaQuantome MCP paper

All of the scripts were run with metaQuantome 0.99.2, which was obtained through Bioconda.

To reproduce the analyses, you can install metaQuantome into a conda environment (also called `metaquantome`) with the following command, then run each of the analysis scripts:

```
conda create -n metaquantome metaquantome
```
